title: "The impossible Wii"

<p>As you can see from <a href="/projects/hardware/rvl-cpu-01-pics.html">here</a>, I own a first motherboard revision
    Wii
    console.<br><br>
    I have had this console since 2009 - and I almost bricked it several times. Originally it had an Argon II modchip,
    (insert blog link here), but I have since removed it and gave it to a friend of mine.<br><br>
    <!--more-->
    Now, all consoles made <a
        href="https://consolemods.org/wiki/Wii:Buying_Guide#%E2%80%9CRVL-CPU-20/30%E2%80%9D_(2007-2009)"
        target="_blank">before 2009</a> had a version of <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Boot1"
        target="_blank">boot1</a> that was vulnerable to <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Signing_bug"
        target="_blank">a
        pretty huge bug</a> that allowed <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/BootMii" target="_blank">BootMii</a> to be
    installed as <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Boot2">boot2</a>.<br><br>
    Given that my console was bought sometimes before August 2009, and given that it's a RVL-CPU-01, it was probably
    manufactured sometimes before 2008, which would make it a likely candidate to have an exploitable version of boot1.
    And yet it doesn't!<br><br>
    Every time I hack this console - which I had to do <i>several times</i> by the way - I can only ever install BootMii
    as <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/IOS" target="_blank">IOS</a> and never as boot2. This should be
    impossible!<br><br>
    My personal guess is that my console was part of what's known as a <a
        href="https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/bonepile-inventory">bonepile inventory</a> (in a similar fashion as
    to what was mentioned in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2d6IMBS8oY" target="_blank">official Xbox 360
        documentary</a>); basically, a console that failed factory tests and was put aside to be fixed later.<br><br>
    Since boot1's hash is written into <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Hollywood" target="_blank">Hollywood</a>'s <a
        href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Hardware/OTP" target="_blank">OTP</a> <a
        href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wii_architecture_overview#Boot_loaders" target="_blank">late in production</a>,
    it is completely possible that this happened:</p>
<ol>
    <li>The console was manufactured around 2006 or 2007, and it failed factory tests, so it was put aside to focus on
        shipping working units around the time of release;</li><br>
    <li>As an effort to clear the bonepile inventory, Nintendo's manufacturing plant recovered my board, fixed whatever
        was wrong with it, wrote the new OTP, flashed the NAND with System Menu 3.2/3.3 (I don't remember exactly what
        version it had) and shipped the console to be sold at retail.</li>
</ol>
<h4><i>And it doesn't end here!</i></h4>
<p>
    For a few years, this console has exibited another unusual behiavor: every time a new title is loaded, the console
    hangs
    on a black screen, no matter what title.<br><br>
    This console is capable of booting a single title once every boot-up, and every subsequent title load (be it
    Nintendo
    software or homebrew stuff) it always hangs.<br><br>
    This is after I reformatted the console and <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Ohneschwanzenegger"
        target="_blank">rebuilt its NAND from scratch</a>. Also, <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Wilbrand"
        target="_blank">Wilbrand</a>, its older variation <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/LetterBomb"
        target="_blank">LetterBomb</a>, and <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Bluebomb" target="_blank">BlueBomb</a>
    crash
    the console with the same black screen issue; only <a href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/Str2hax"
        target="_blank">str2hax</a> works reliably.<br><br>
    The only likely explanation I have is that since titles are stored in the NAND, an IOS syscall is made to the
    Starlet to read the title and load it into memory, and the Starlet somehow completely fumbles itself somewhere (maybe TMD verification? maybe a hardware failure? I have no idea),
    throws an exception and hangs the console. But without a debugger (such as an <a
        href="https://wiibrew.org/wiki/USB_Gecko" target="_blank">USBGecko</a>), I have no way to know.<br><br>
    Also: the SD card reader despises SDHC/SDXC cards, and the disc drive is likely completely dead due to having to read a lot of DVD-Rs in the past (and I'm sure you can figure out why).<br><br>
