title: About me

I'm scudo, I'm the sysadmin of this page.<br><br>
I love to tinker with stuff and see what comes out of it - mainly in the realm of technology - but also photography and music.<br><br><br>

I am a very reserved person. If you need to get in touch with me, or wish to know me better, send me
an email <div id="mail"><script src="/assets/js/email.js"></script></div> so I can give you my Discord username or something.<br><br>
(Please don't get mad if I don't reply, I don't check that mailbox very often...)
<!-- dunno why it wraps. though, this is anti-email scraper protection (hopefully!) -->
